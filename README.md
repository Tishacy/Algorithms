# Algorithms

This repository is to store some algorithm exercises, which is something like a cheatsheet that I can refer back later. All codes are in `code` directory.

- `0 pick_based_on_prob.py`: 3 ways to implement picking one element from an array (or list) with probability assigned to it.
  - Giant array pool method
  - Accept/Rejection method
  - Bar method (RECOMMENDED)
- `1 genetic_algorithm.py`: An easy example to implement the genetic algorithm (GA).
