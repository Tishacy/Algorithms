# Algorithms

This repository is to store some algorithm exercises, which is something like a cheatsheet that I can refer back later. All codes are in `code` directory.

- [`0 pick_based_on_prob.py`](./code/0%20pick_based_on_prob.py): 3 ways to implement picking one element from an array (or list) with probability assigned.
  - Giant array pool method
  - Accept/Rejection method
  - Bar method (RECOMMENDED)
- [`1 genetic_algorithm.py`](./code/1%20genetic_algorithm.py): An easy example to implement the genetic algorithm (GA).
- [`2 sorting.py`](./code/2%20sorting.py): Commen sorting algorithms
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
  - Counting sort
- [`3 heapsort.py`](./code/3%20heapsort.py): Heap sort algorithm.
- [`4 divide_and_conquer.py`](./code/4%20divide_and_conquer.py): Some algorithms that implement the **Divide and Conquer** method.
  - Binary search
  - Calculate the n power of x
  - Fibonacci using matrix tricks
